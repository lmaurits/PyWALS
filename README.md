PyWALS
======

Pythonic interface to the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS).

WALS is a valuable source of data for researchers interested in language
typology, language evolution and related disciplines.  This Python
library aims to break that data free from the confines of web interfaces
and .csv files and provide a rich, intuitive way to get directly at the
data you are interested in from inside Python.  This lets you easily
make ad-hoc queries of WALS from the interactive prompt, or script up
complicated quantitative analyses for research projects.

This project is in its early stages, so check back often!
